* After the function returns -1, [[_RESIZEWIDTH]] and [[_RESIZEHEIGHT]] can return the new dimensions in pixels.
* The [[$RESIZE]]:ON [[metacommand]] must be used so the program is created with a user resizable window.
* '''QB64 GL''' programs only. Not available in QB64 SDL versions .954 and older.

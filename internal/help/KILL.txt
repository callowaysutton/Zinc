The '''KILL''' statement deletes a file on a relative path designated by a [[STRING]] value or variable.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: KILL filespec$


* Filespec is a literal or variable string path and filename. Wildcards * and ? can be used but '''be careful!'''
::'''*''' denotes one or more wildcard letters of a name or extension
::'''?''' denotes one wildcard letter of a name or extension

* Path can be relative to program's current location or use an absolute path from the root drive.
* KILL cannot remove an [[OPEN]] file. The program MUST [[CLOSE]] it first.  
* If the path or file does not exist, a &quot;File not found&quot; or &quot;Path not found&quot; [[ERROR Codes|error]] will result.
* [[SHELL]] ''&quot;DEL /Q &quot; + filename$'' does the same without a prompt or verification for wildcard deletions.
* [[SHELL]] ''&quot;DEL /P &quot; + filename$'' will ask for user verification. 
* Cannot delete folders or directories! Use [[RMDIR]] to remove empty folders only!
* '''Warning! Files deleted in DOS or QB64 will NOT go to the Recycle Bin and they CANNOT be restored!'''

The '''FREEFILE''' function returns an [[INTEGER]] value that is an unused file access number.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: file1% = FREEFILE


* FREEFILE values should be given to unique variables so that each file has a specific variable value assigned to it.
* Once the number is assigned in an [[OPEN]] statement, the file number can later be used to read, write or [[CLOSE]] that file.
* Files numbers [[CLOSE]]d are made available to FREEFILE for reuse immediately. 
* FREEFILE returns are normally sequential starting with 1. Only file numbers in use will not be returned.
* [[OPEN]] each file number after each FREEFILE return or the values returned may be the same!
* [[OPEN COM]] statements cannot use any number assigned to files already OPEN!

{{PageDescription}}
* QB64 can use an unlimited number of ON TIMER (number, seconds!) event {{KW|INTEGER}} values at once. 
* Every time _FREETIMER is called the [[INTEGER]] value returned will increase by one, starting at 1, whether it is used or not.
* Store multiple returns in different variable names to refer to separate events later.

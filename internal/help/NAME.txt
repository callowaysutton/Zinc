The '''NAME''' statement changes the name of a file or directory to a new name.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: NAME ''old_filename$'' AS ''new_filename$''


{{PageDescription}}
* Filenames are variables or literal [[STRING]]s in quotes. Paths can be included.
* Long filenames can be used in QB64 only! Qbasic requires the DOS 8.3 (folder maximum of 8) naming convention.
* If the two paths are different, the statement moves the original file to the new path and renames it.
* If the path is the same or a path is not included, the original file is just renamed.
* [[SHELL]] can use &quot;REN &quot; + filename$ + &quot; &quot; newname$ in DOS.
* Path or filename [[ERROR Codes|errors]] are possible and should be handled in the program.
* '''CAUTION: There is no prompt to continue or execution verification!'''

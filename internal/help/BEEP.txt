The '''BEEP''' statement produces a beeping sound through the sound card(QB64) or PC speaker(QB) if it has one.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: [[BEEP]]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{KW|BEEP}} can be placed anywhere to alert the user that there is something to do or an error has occurred.
* [[ASCII]] control character 7 can also create a {{KW|BEEP}} sound when you {{KW|PRINT}} it (See [[CHR$]]).
* In Windows it may produce a &quot;thunk&quot; warning sound when a Qbasic program is running in a  {{KW|SCREEN}} 0 window.
* Newer PC's may not have an internal speaker to hear ANY Qbasic [[SOUND|sounds]]!
* '''QB64''' produces the actual &quot;beep&quot; sound through the PC's stereo speakers.
* To produce the BEEP sound character in a QBasic(.BAS) or a batch(.BAT) file using a '''DOS''' editor (or the QB IDE) press ''Ctrl + P'' then ''G.'' PRINT it inside of quotation marks to beep in QB. Use the character after ECHO in a batch file. '''Not in the QB64 IDE!'''

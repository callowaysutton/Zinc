The '''ACCESS''' clause is used in a networking {{KW|OPEN}} statement. DOS 3.1 or above only!



{{PageSyntax}}
:OPEN &quot;file.dat&quot; FOR APPEND ['''ACCESS {READ|WRITE}'''] AS #1

{{PageDescription}}


''Valid Options:''
*Default: When specified, all other processes are denied file access.
*READ: When specified, read access is denied to other file procedures.
*WRITE: When specified, write access is denied to other file procedures.
*READ WRITE: When specified any access is denied to other file procedures.


''Limitations:''
* Requires that the DOS '''SHARED.EXE''' program be run for QBasic to use networking access modes.

{{KW|CASE ELSE}} is used in a {{KW|SELECT CASE}} procedure as an alternative if no other {{KW|CASE}} statements are true. 


{{PageDescription}}

* CASE ELSE should be listed at the bottom of the case list as it will supercede any case statements after it.
* Use it as a &quot;safety net&quot; or as an alternative for ALL values not covered in the {{KW|CASE}} statements.

{{PageSyntax}}
::: '''CLOSE''' [''filenumber''[, ...]]


''[[Parameters]]:''
* ''filenumber'' indicates the file or list of file numbers to close. When not designated all files are closed.


''Usage:''
* A file MUST be closed when changing to another file mode.
* CLOSE files when they are no longer needed to save memory.
* Files cannot be opened in the same [[OPEN]] mode using another number until the first one is closed.
* Use holding variables for each file number returned by [[FREEFILE]] so that the file reference is known.
* Will not return an error if a filenumber is already closed or was never opened. It does not verify that a file was closed.
* [[CLEAR]] will also close all open files.
* CLOSE can also be used to close an open TCP/IP connection using a handle returned by '''QB64'''.

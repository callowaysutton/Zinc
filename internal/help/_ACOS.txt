{{DISPLAYTITLE:_ACOS}}
The '''_ACOS''' function returns the angle measured in radians based on an input [[COS]]ine value ranging from -1 to 1.


{{PageSyntax}} 
::::: radian_angle! = _ACOS(''cosine_value!'')


* The ''cosine_value!'' must be measured &gt;= -1 and &lt;= 1, or an error will be generated.  (PRINT _ACOS(1.2) would give the result of -1.#IND, which is basically QB64's way of telling us that the number doesn't exist, much like 1/0 would.) 
* ARCCOSINE is the inverse function of [[COS]]ine, which lets us turn a [[COS]]ine value back into an angle.
* Note: Due to rounding with floating point math, the _ACOS may not always give a perfect match for the COS angle which generated this.  You can reduce the number of rounding errors by increasing the precision of your calculations by using [[DOUBLE]] or [[_FLOAT]] precision variables instead of [[SINGLE]].

{{Cl|DEFDBL}} A-Z

{{Cl|INPUT}} &quot;Give me an Angle (in Degrees) =&gt; &quot;; Angle
{{Cl|PRINT}}
C = {{Cl|COS}}({{Cl|_D2R}}(Angle)) '_D2R is the command to convert Degrees to Radians, which is what COS expects
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;The COSINE of the Angle is: &quot;; C
A = {{Cl|_ACOS}}(C)
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;The ACOS of &quot;; C; &quot; is: &quot;; A
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, the value is &quot;; {{Cl|_R2D}}(A) '' ''

{{small|Example by SMcNeill}}
{{OutputStart}}
Give me an Angle (in Degrees) =&gt; ? 60

The COSINE of the Angle is:  .5000000000000001
The ACOS of  .5000000000000001  is:  1.047197551196598
Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, we discover the value is  60

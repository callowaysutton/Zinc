{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SNDCLOSE}}
The [[_SNDCLOSE]] statement frees and unloads an open sound using a [[_SNDOPEN]] or [[_SNDCOPY]] handle.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: [[_SNDCLOSE]] {{Parameter|handle&amp;}}


{{PageDescription}}
* If the sound is still playing, it will be freed after it finishes automatically.
* Closing a looping/paused/etc. sound will mean it is never freed until the QB64 program terminates.
* Non-SYNC sounds must be closed before another Non-SYNC sound can be opened.
* When your QB64 program terminates, all sounds are automatically freed

{{DISPLAYTITLE:_MOUSESHOW}}
The '''_MOUSESHOW''' statement displays the mouse cursor and can determine its shape in GL.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: '''_MOUSESHOW''' [''cursortype$'']


''Description:''
* Simply use the statement whenever [[_MOUSEHIDE]] has been used previously.
* In '''QB64 GL''' the following [[STRING]] cursor types can be displayed:
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;LINK&quot; will display an upward pointing hand cursor used to denote hypertext
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;TEXT&quot; will display the I cursor often used in text entry areas 
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;CROSSHAIR&quot; will display a crosshair cursor
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;VERTICAL&quot; will display vertical arrow cursor for movement
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;HORIZONTAL&quot; will display horizontal arrow cursor for movement
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;TOPLEFT_BOTTOMRIGHT&quot; will display bottom diagonal arrow cursor for movement
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;TOPRIGHT_BOTTOMLEFT&quot; will display bottom diagonal arrow cursor for movement
::_MOUSESHOW &quot;DEFAULT&quot; can be used after a mouse cursor statement above was previously used.
* This statement will also disable [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTX]] or [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTY]] relative mouse movement reads.
* The mouse cursor will not interfere with any print or graphic screen changes in '''QB64'''.
* _MOUSEHIDE statements do not accumulate like they did with [[ABSOLUTE]] or [[INTERRUPT]] in Qbasic.


''Example 1:'' '''QB64 GL''' allows special cursors to be displayed by using special string parameters:

: '''Note:''' There is no hourglass, stopwatch or spinning colorful wheel in the list. The fact is that these typically only appear in a program when something has gone terribly wrong and the program has crashed or frozen.

The '''ENVIRON''' statement is used '''in Windows''' to temporarily set or change an environmental string value.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: ENVIRON string_expression$


* [[Keywords_currently_not_supported_by_QB64]]
* The string expression must include the environmental parameter ID and the setting two ways:
: * Using an = : ENVIRON parameterID=setting
: * Using a space: ENVIRON parameterID setting 
* If the parameter ID did not previously exist in the environmental string table, it is appended to the end of the table.
* If a parameter ID did exist, it is deleted and the new value is appended to end of the list.
* DOS discards any changes when your program ends so the program must set them when run!
* '''WARNING:''' The amount of space in a environmental table is limited and may create memory errors.

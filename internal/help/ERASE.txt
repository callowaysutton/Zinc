The '''ERASE''' statement is used to clear all data from an array. [[$STATIC]] [[Arrays|array]] dimensions will not be changed.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: ERASE ''ArrayName'' [, ''arrayname2''...]



* String array elements will all become null strings(&quot;&quot;) and numerical array elements will all become 0.
* Multiple arrays can be erased using commas between the array names.
* [[$DYNAMIC|Dynamic]] arrays MUST be [[REDIM]]ensioned if they are referenced after erased. 
* Dimension subprocedure arrays as [[STATIC]] to use ERASE and not have to REDIM.
* You do not have to include the array brackets in an ERASE call.

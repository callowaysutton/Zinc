{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SNDCOPY}}
The [[_SNDCOPY]] function copies a sound to a new handle so that two or more of the same sound can be played at once. The passed handle parameter is from the [[_SNDOPEN]] function.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: copy_handle&amp; = '''_SNDCOPY('''{{Parameter|handle&amp;}}''')'''


{{PageDescription}}
* Opened sound files must have the &quot;SYNC&quot; capability to use this function. (Currently WAV, OGG, AIF, RIF and VOC)
* Returns a new handle to the same sound data referred to by the source handle.

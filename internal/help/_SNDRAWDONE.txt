{{PageSyntax}}
::: [[_SNDRAWDONE]]


''Details:''
* It's not necessary to call this at all because the size of a buffer section is about 1/10th of a second.
* For long sound effect it will probably make no difference. 
* '''QB64 GL''' programs only. Not available in QB64 SDL versions .954 and older.

'''$ELSE''' is precompiler command, which determines which sections of code inside its blocks are included into our code for compiling.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: $IF variable = expression THEN...
::.
:: $ELSE
::.
:: $END IF

* $ELSE must follow a valid $IF statement
* There can only be one $ELSE in an $IF-$ELSEIF-$ELSE-$END IF block, and it must be the last block selection before the $END IF.  $ELSEIF ''can not'' follow $ELSE.


''Example 1:'' 
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|$IF}} WIN THEN
    {{Cl|CONST}} Slash = &quot;\&quot;
{{Cl|$ELSE}}
    {{Cl|CONST}} Slash = &quot;/&quot;
{{Cl|$END IF}}

{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;The proper slash for your operating system is &quot;; Slash
{{CodeEnd}}

For the above, the CONST slash is defined by the automatic internal flag (WIN), which tells us what operating system we're using.  On a windows PC, the Slash will be the backslash; for any other OS it will be the forward slash.

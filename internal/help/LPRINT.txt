The {{KW|LPRINT}} statement sends string text or numerical values to a parallel port(LPT1) printer in Qbasic or a USB printer in '''QB64'''.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|LPRINT}} [{{Parameter|expression}}] [{;|,}]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|expression}} is one or more text or numerical expressions separated by a semi-colon (;) or comma (,).
* Syntax is the same as [[PRINT]], but cannot use a port number.
* Program does not have to [[OPEN]] the LPT1: parallel port. In fact that is NOT recommended!
* Assumes a 80 character wide page unless a [[WIDTH|WIDTH LPRINT]] statement is used. '''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|WIDTH LPRINT is currently NOT supported in QB64!]]'''
* [[LPRINT USING]] can print formatted text data to a page identically to how [[PRINT USING]] formats a program screen.
* [[COLOR]]ed text and images can be printed using [[_PRINTIMAGE]] which stretches them to fit the default printer's paper size.
* LPRINT will only print to the DEFAULT USB or LPT printer that works in Windows.  '''[[Keywords_currently_not_supported_by_QB64#Keywords_Not_Supported_in_Linux_or_MAC_OSX_versions|Keyword Not Supported in Linux or MAC versions]]'''
* Note: Printer Escape codes starting with [[CHR$]](27) will not work with LPRINT and may produce text printing errors.

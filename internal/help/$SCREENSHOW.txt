The '''$SCREENSHOW''' [[Metacommand]] can be used to display the main program window throughout the program.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: $SCREENSHOW


* The Metacommand is intended to be used in a modular program when a screen surface is necessary in one or more modules.
* $SCREENSHOW can only be used AFTER [[$SCREENHIDE]] or [[_SCREENHIDE]] have been used in another program module!
* If [[$SCREENHIDE]] and $SCREENSHOW are used in the same program module the window will never be hidden.
* '''QB64 [[Metacommand]]s require that commenting or [[REM]] NOT be used!'''

{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SNDBAL}}
The [[_SNDBAL]] statement attempts to set the balance or 3D position of a sound.


{{PageSyntax}}
:::[[_SNDBAL]] {{Parameter|handle&amp;}}[, {{Parameter|x!}}][, {{Parameter|y!}}][, {{Parameter|z!}}]


{{PageDescription}}
*Attempts to position a sound in 3D space, or as close to it as the underlying software libraries allow. In some cases, this will be true 3D positioning, in others, a mere volume adjustment based on distance alone.
:::*x distance values go from left(negative) to right(positive).
:::*y distance values go from below(negative) to above(positive).
:::*z distance values go from behind(negative) to in front(positive).
*Omitted x, y or z {{KW|SINGLE}} values are set to 0.
*By setting the x value to -1 or 1 it plays the sound at full volume from the appropriate speaker.
*Sounds at a distance of 1 or -1 are played at full volume. Sounds further than a distance of 1000 cannot be heard.
*The volume decreases linearly (at a constant gradient) over distance. Half volume = 500.
* Opened sound files must have the &quot;VOL&quot; capability to use this statement.
* The sound file should have the &quot;SYNC&quot; capability when more than one sound is being used at the same time!
* An &quot;'''ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL'''&quot; error can occur if another sound is using the primary or same channel position.

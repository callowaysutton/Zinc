'''ELSE''' is used in [[IF...THEN]] or [[SELECT CASE]] statements to offer an alternative to other conditional statements.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: IF condition &lt;&gt; 0 THEN evaluation = -1 [[ELSE]] evaluation = 0


''Block {{PageSyntax}}
:: IF condition &gt; 0 THEN
:: evaluation = -1
:: [[ELSEIF]] condition &lt; 0 THEN evaluation = -1 
:: [[ELSE]] evaluation = 0
:: [[END IF]]


* ELSE is used in a IF block statement to cover any remaining conditions not covered in the block by IF or [[ELSEIF]].
* [[CASE ELSE]] covers any remaining conditions not covered by the other CASE statements.
* ELSE can also be used as a False comparison to a True IF statement when a condition will only be True or False.
* Other [[IF...THEN]] statements can be inside of an ELSE statement.


''Example 1:'' One line IF statement
{{CodeStart}}

IF x = 100 THEN PRINT &quot;100&quot; ELSE PRINT &quot;Not 100&quot;

{{CodeEnd}}

''Example 2:'' Multiple line IF statement block
{{CodeStart}}

IF x = 100 THEN ' code executed MUST be on next statement line!
   PRINT &quot;100&quot;
ELSE PRINT &quot;Not 100&quot;
END IF

{{CodeEnd}}


''Example 3:'' To alternate between any two values (as long as the value after ELSE is the same as the condition)
{{CodeStart}}

IF a = 3 THEN a = 5 ELSE a = 3

{{CodeEnd}}

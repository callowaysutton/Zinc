The '''RESUME''' statement is used with [[NEXT]] or a linenumber or label in an Error handling routine ONLY.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''RESUME''' {[[NEXT]]|''linelabel''|''linenumber''}


* [[NEXT]] returns execution to the code immediately following the error.
* A ''[[line number]]'' or ''line label'' is the code line to return to after an error.
* If the line label or number is omitted or the line number = 0, the code execution resumes at the code that created the original error.
* RESUME can only be used in ERROR handling routines! Use [[RETURN]] in normal [[GOSUB]] procedures.

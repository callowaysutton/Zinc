The '''DEFINT''' statement defines all designated undefined variables AS [[INTEGER]] variables instead of the [[SINGLE]] type default.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''DEFSINT ''letter'''''[-''range'']


* The variable first letters can be from A-Z or any other range. 
* You can also use commas for specific untyped variable first letters.
* Variables [[DIM]]ensioned as another variable type or that use type suffixes are not defined otherwise.
* DEFINT allows users to create larger graphical arrays up to the integer limits. 
* The maximum value of a signed Integer variable is 32767. Minimum is -32768.
* [[UNSIGNED]] Integer values from 0 to 65535 must use [[_DEFINE]]
* DEFINT sets the [[type]] of all variable names with the starting letter(s) or letter ranges  when encountered in the progression of the program(even in conditional statement blocks not executed and subsequent [[SUB]] procedures). 
* '''Qbasic's IDE may add DEF statements before any [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]]. QB64(like QB) will change all variable types in subsequent sub-procedures to that default variable type without giving a [[ERROR Codes|&quot;Parameter Type Mismatch&quot;]] warning or adding the proper DEF statement to subsequent procedures! If you do not want that to occur, either remove that DEF statement or add the proper DEF type statements to subsequent procedures. May also affect [[$INCLUDE]] procedures!'''
* '''Warning: Qbasic keyword names cannot be used as numerical variable names with or without the type suffix!'''


''Examples:'' 
:: DEFINT A-Z
:: DEFINT A-D, Z
:: DEFINT A, I, O

{{DISPLAYTITLE:_DONTWAIT}}
[[_DONTWAIT]] is used with the {{KW|SHELL}} statement to specify that the program shouldn't wait until the SHELLed command/program is finished (which it otherwise does by default).


{{PageSyntax}}
::: [[SHELL]] ['''_DONTWAIT'''] [{{Parameter|commandline$}}]


{{PageDescription}}
*Can only be used in the {{KW|SHELL}} statement when using '''QB64'''.
*Runs the command/program specified in {{Parameter|commandline$}} and lets the calling program continue at the same time in it's current screen format.
*Especially useful when CMD /C or START is used in a SHELL command line to run another program. 
* '''QB64''' automatically uses CMD /C or COMMAND /C when using SHELL. 
* '''QB64''' program screens will not get distorted or minimized like Qbasic fullscreen modes could.

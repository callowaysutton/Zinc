The '''GOTO''' statement sends the procedure to a line label or a line number in the program.



{{PageSyntax}} 
::GOTO {line_number|line_label}


''IF GOTO {{PageSyntax}}
:: IF x &gt; 0 [[GOTO]] {line_number|line_label}


* Codeline is a ''[[line number|linenumber]]'' or ''linelabel'' in a procedure. Keep line numbers and labels inside of the main or sub-procedure body!
* The line label or number MUST already exist or an [[IDE]] status error will be displayed until it is created!
* Can be used in [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures using their own line labels or numbers.
* The frequent use of GOTO statements can become confusing when trying to follow the code. Could also cause endless loops!
* GOTO is an easy trap for new programmers. Use loops instead when possible.


''Example:''
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
1 {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;first line&quot;: {{Cl|GOTO}} gohere
2 {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;second line&quot;: {{Cl|GOTO}} 3

gohere:
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;third line&quot;
{{Cl|GOTO}} 2

3 {{Cl|END}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
first line
third line
second line
{{OutputEnd}}

:''Explanation:'' After it prints &quot;first line&quot; it goes to the line label &quot;gohere&quot; where it prints &quot;third line&quot;, then it goes to the line that is numbered &quot;2&quot; and prints &quot;second line&quot; and goes to line number 3 and an [[END]] statement which ends the program.

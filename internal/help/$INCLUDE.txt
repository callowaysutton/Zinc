'''$INCLUDE''' is a metacommand that is used to insert a source code file into your program which is then executed at the point of the insertion.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: {[[REM]] | [[REM|']] } $INCLUDE: 'sourcefile'


* Qbasic required that a comment or REM preceded all [[Metacommand]]s at the start of the program.
* The ''source file'' name MUST have REM or apostrophe comments around the text source file name. 
* $INCLUDE is often used to add functions and subs from an external text QBasic code library.
* The source file included can contain any BASIC statement except [[GOTO]] 
* QB 4.5 can use [[DECLARE]] SUB in BI files such as [[QB.BI]]. '''QB64''' ignores Qbasic's [[DECLARE]] statements.
* '''QB64 users can use all statements in their include files. See below.'''
* The $INCLUDE metacommand should be the only statement on a line since execution progresses ''after'' the code line.



&lt;center&gt;'''How to $INCLUDE a BAS or Text file with a QB64 Program'''&lt;/center&gt;
* '''QB64''' does not require a comment or [[REM]] before any [[Metacommand]]. '''Do NOT comment QB64 specific [[Metacommand]]s!'''
* The ''source file'' name MUST have REM or apostrophe comments around the text source file name.
* 1) Assemble your text code into a TEXT file and name it something with a '''.BI''' or '''.BM''' file name extension.
* 2) $INCLUDE any [[DEFINT]], [[DIM]], [[CONST]], [[SHARED]] arrays or [[DATA]] at the very '''beginning''' of the main program code. 
* 3) $INCLUDE [[SUB]]s or [[FUNCTION]]s at the very bottom of the main program code '''AFTER any SUB procedures.'''
::: '''Note:''' [[TYPE]] definitions, [[DATA]] and [[DECLARE LIBRARY]] can be placed inside of sub-procedures.
* 4) '''Compile''' the program with the included text files '''in the QB64 folder!''' Save the text files to use them like '''Library files'''.
&lt;center&gt;'''Note: Once the program is compiled, the included text files are no longer needed with the program EXE.'''&lt;/center&gt;


''Example:'' ''' '$INCLUDE:''' '[[QB.BI]]'


''See Library Examples:'' 
* [[SelectScreen]] (member $INCLUDE demo) 
* [[FILELIST$ (function)]] (member FILE Search function)
* [[SAVEIMAGE]] (SUB program that creates bitmaps)

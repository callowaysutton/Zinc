The $CHECKING metacommand turns C++ event checking ON or OFF.


''Syntax:'' $CHECKING:OFF


* The Metacommand does '''NOT''' require a comment or REM before it! There is no space after the colon.
* The OFF action turns event checking off and should '''ONLY be used when running stable, errorless code!''' 
* The default $CHECKING:ON action is only required when checking has been turned OFF previously.
* When $CHECKING:OFF is used, all error code and the reporting code is removed from the EXE program.
* '''WARNING! Turning OFF error checking could create a General Protection Fault!'''


''Explanation:'' After every QB64 command a C++ check as follows is performed: If (qbevent){...

: Using [[ON TIMER (n)]] merely sets qbevent when appropriate, causing little/no difference to the speed your program runs. Unless you are using the QB64 direct meta-command to avoid this:

:::$CHECKING:OFF

:But turning checking off is only designed for 100% stable, error-less sections of code, where every CPU cycle saved counts. Such as in a software 3D texture mapper.

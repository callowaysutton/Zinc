'''ELSEIF''' is used in a block [[IF...THEN]] statement to offer an alternative condition.


''Block'' {{PageSyntax}}
:: IF condition &gt; 0 THEN
:: evaluation = -1
:: [[ELSEIF]] condition &lt; 0 THEN evaluation = -1 
:: [[ELSE]] evaluation = 0
:: [[END IF]]


* ELSEIF statements REQUIRE a '''separate''' code block line with [[THEN]] for each alternative condition.
* There can be more than one [[ELSE]] IF statement in a single-line IF statement.
* If there is only ONE possible alternative condition(such as 0 or [[NOT]] 0), then use [[ELSE]] instead.
* If the comparisons are based on multiple conditions being true, it may require many ELSEIF comparisons. ELSE could help cover some of those conditions.
* You can use [[SELECT CASE]] when IF blocks have a long list of alterative ELSEIF conditions.

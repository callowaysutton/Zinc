The '''MKDIR''' statement creates a new directory at a specified path.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: MKDIR pathspec$


* The path specification is a literal or variable [[STRING]] expression that also specifies the new folder's name.
* If no path is given the directory will become a sub-directory of the present directory where the program is currently running.
* Qbasic folder names are limited to 8 characters(no spaces) and filenames use the 8.3 naming convention.
* '''QB64''' can use both long or short path and file names with spaces when required.
* The new folder will be created without a user prompt or verification. 
* If a path is specified, the path MUST exist or a [[ERROR Codes|&quot;Path not found&quot; error]] will occur.
* [[SHELL]] can use the DOS command &quot;MD &quot; or &quot;MKDIR &quot; + path$ + newfolder$ to do the same thing.

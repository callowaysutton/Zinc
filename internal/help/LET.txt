The '''LET''' is a useless statement designed by [[cavemen]] when they started programming.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: [LET] variable = expression


* LET a = 12 is the same as a = 12 but wastes 4 extra bytes of program space. 
* Teachers should be SHOT for even teaching about it! Move on!

''Notes:'' LET is '''optional''', its the only keyword where the '''entire keyword''' is optional :)


''See also:'' 
* [[Cavemen]]

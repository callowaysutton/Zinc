{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SOURCE}}
The [[_SOURCE]] statement establishes the image SOURCE using a handle created by [[_LOADIMAGE]] or [[_NEWIMAGE]].


{{PageSyntax}}
::: [[_SOURCE]] {{Parameter|handle&amp;}}


{{PageDescription}}
* The handle is a {{KW|LONG}} integer value from the {{KW|_SOURCE (function)|_SOURCE}} function or a handle created by [[_NEWIMAGE]]. 
* If the handle is designated as 0, it refers to the current [[SCREEN]] image.
* A source image can only supply information to a program. [[POINT]] and [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] might require a source other than the present one.

: ''Explanation:'' Create a new image with handle 'a', then use {{KW|_DEST}} to define the image to draw on. Draw a pixel then set the source to 'a' and use {{KW|POINT}} to show what color is in that position. White (15) and is the color set with {{KW|PSET}}. Use {{KW|_DEST}} 0 for the screen to display the results.

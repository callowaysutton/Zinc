The {{KW|SYSTEM}} statement immediately closes a program and in DOS and can avoid returning to the QBasic [[IDE]]. 


{{PageSyntax}}
:'''SYSTEM''' [return_code%]


{{Parameters}}
* QB64 allows a ''code'' number to be used after SYSTEM to be read in another program module by the [[SHELL]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] functions.


''Usage:''
* This command should be used to close a program quickly instead of pausing with [[END]] or nothing at all.
* A code can be added after the statement to send a value to the [[SHELL (function)]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] function in another module.
* If a program BAS module is run from the IDE, stopped by Ctrl-Break or an error occurs the QB program will exit to the [[IDE]].
* In '''QB64''' SYSTEM ends the program and closes the window immediately. The last screen image may not be displayed.
* '''Qbasic BAS files can be run like compiled programs without returning to the [[IDE]] when [[SYSTEM]] is used to [[END|end]] them!'''
* To run a QuickBasic program without the [[IDE]] use the following [[DOS]] command line: {{text|QB.EXE /L /RUN filename.BAS|green}}

{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|CALLS}} {{Parameter|name}} [({{Parameter|argumentlist}})]


* [[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|Currently NOT supported in QB64]]
* The arguments are passed by reference as far addresses, unlike {{KW|CALL}} which passes arguments by value as default. You cannot use {{KW|BYVAL}} or {{KW|SEG}} in a {{KW|CALLS}} argumentlist.



{{KW|CALLS}} is the same as using {{KW|CALL}} with a {{KW|SEG}} before each argument.

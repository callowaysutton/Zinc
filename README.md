# Zinc 0.0.2.4
Only on Windows for now, will build for Linux and Mac OS once I have finished setting up the GUI and all of the dependencies for the file menu, help menu, licenses, etc.

# How to Use?
To open just run the file called "Start Zinc.exe" and it will open up the IDE and a background executer (for the help menus)
The only functional file menu option is 'New' and in that all you can do is press cancel :P

## Plans:
### - I'm going to try and make the Zinc drag and drop language as compatible with QB64 as I can
### - Export directly to executable formats
### - Support (full) vector graphics [maybe]


## ZINC IS STILL IN ITS MOST EARLY PHASES, IT WILL PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF ERRORS/GLITCHES
## Use at your own risk

# Zinc IDE
## What is Zinc
Zinc is a drag and drop based programming IDE for beginners who are looking for somewhere to start
## What are are the Origins of Zinc?
Zinc is based off of Scratch and one of the 1.4 mods, Explore. I hope to be able to integrate most of what the two have into Zinc (and possibly add in building your own blocks with Assembly)
